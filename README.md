## Introduction
Emotion detection in text is a significant area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing the emotions expressed in a given text. This project focuses on detecting emotions in Persian tweets using the ParsBERT model, a pre-trained BERT model specifically fine-tuned for Persian language tasks.

## Features
- Detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust in Persian tweets.
- Utilizes the ParsBERT model for robust language understanding.
- Easy to use and integrate into other applications.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of Persian tweets labeled with various emotions.

## Model
This project uses the ParsBERT model, a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on Persian text. More information about ParsBERT can be found [here](https://github.com/HooshvareLab/ParsBERT).

## Results
My emotion detection model on Persian tweets performed with a 93% accuracy.
